# 🌍 NDVI-BASEED LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION
A Kaggle competition project built for **Summer Analytics 2025 Hackathon**, hosted by 📊 Consulting & Analytics Club and 🤖 GeeksforGeeks. This repository tackles the challenge of classifying land cover types using **NDVI time-series satellite data** with **Logistic Regression**—despite noisy, missing, and seasonally varying data.

---

## 📁 PROJECT SUMMARY

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a crucial vegetation health indicator. Our goal is to classify land cover types—`Water`, `Impervious`, `Farm`, `Forest`, `Grass`, `Orchard`—using NDVI time-series data. Due to cloud noise and seasonal effects, feature engineering and noise handling play a vital role.

**✅ FINAL PUBLIC LEADERBOARD ACCURACY : 0.92416+**

## 📊 KEY TECHNIQUES USED

- 🧼 **Missing Value Imputation** using **KNN Imputer**
- 📆 **Seasonal Feature Engineering**: Mean NDVI for Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall
- 📉 **Statistical Features**: NDVI Standard Deviation across time
- ⚖️ **Balanced Logistic Regression** (Multi-class) using `class_weight='balanced'`
- 🔄 **Standard Scaling** to normalize NDVI ranges
- 📈 Model evaluation using **accuracy score** and **classification report**
